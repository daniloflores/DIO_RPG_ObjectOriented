# DIO_RPG_ObjectOriented
Objetive: Simulate RPG characters in a simple console application, to implement the object-oriented concepts in C#.
This is a challenge proposed by [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) in one of their C#/.NET courses.

## Instructions
- Represent RPG characters in a console application
- Characters should be implemented as objects
- Different character types should inherit from a generic Hero class (parent class)
- The child classes can override the parent methods as needed
